# Tintouin's desktop configs [WIP]
Configs for linux 

used on debian by Le_TINTOUIN
###### This is a darkmode config
I started to write my dotfiles in order to conserve my work. <br />
I was also motivated by the fact that I wanted to switch from debian to arch in order to pursue my "linux trip". Like I've already done big switches before. <br />
#### The goal of a full rice for my own use
I made it public so everyone can see it or even use it but it's not made for any community so if you want to change sompething on the main file, like submit me a cool theme that you find legitimate here, but it'll appear in the main ONLY if I want to use it myself !
## Requirements
### xfce4
Last LTS
### i3
&nbsp; ↳ Normally you'll automaticaly get i3bar and i3status with i3<br />
### i3blocks
An i3status pushed to its best.
### zsh + oh my zsh
The prompt that I discovered with Kali. I fell in love with it, Oh-My-zsh you made it so easy !
### gogh themes 
Use this command→ `bash -c  "$(wget -qO- https://git.io/vQgMr)" ` <br />
For my favourites themes (and the one that I think can suit the general theme) type `12 14 25 74 80 85 167 199 218 222 224` <br />
If you want to select you owns check this website : https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/
### Ubunly
Just see here https://github.com/alejandromume/ubunly-zsh-theme I even made my own fork for it. check it here : https://github.com/alejandromume/ubunly-zsh-theme/pull/4
### GTK 
&nbsp; ↳ Since you have xfce4 you may normally have gtk <br />
Here is the theme that I've selected : https://github.com/TerminalHash/Modern <br />
In my opinion it fits perfectly the violet/magenta theme I built here but feel free to chose your own and send a pull request !
### BONUS: Firefox theme
I've choosen the theme **Purple Prizm** <br />
You can add it to your firefox here : https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/purple-prizm/
## To read if you have some time to lose
For those pilgrims who will find this note on their way to becoming a "super user" or a "Linux wizard". You may already know that there are many paths to this higher state of being, and you may also know that there are as many paths as there are people on them. So take this as an example, not as a model. I have been trapped disappointed and satisfied along this path and I know very well that it is not over yet, I still have to discover Arch, i3-gaps, alacritty and many others! 

So here is my path :  <br />
Xubuntu xfce → Debian xfce → Kali linux xfce → Kali linux i3 → Debian i3 → and now Arch linux i3-gaps


I know it may seem absurd to put these words of "poetry" on a github readme. Anyway, if it seems absurd to you, it's because you've never experimented before to find a story like this one by reading documentations or in manpages, you know, those little jokes that programmers put in their code...
I leave you with this anonymous quote found in several source codes:
```//Dear Dev,
//Know that when I wrote this code, only God and I
//knew how this one works.
//Henceforth, only God knows!
//
//But if you still want to try to optimize it and it doesn't 
//work (which is very likely to happen),
//Thank you for incrementing this counter to warn the next 
//person.
//
//wasted_hours = 254
